# Git-Native API Client

This skill allows you to manage API requests as repository-native Markdown files. This ensures that API documentation and test cases live alongside the code, are version-controlled, and can be reviewed via standard Pull Request workflows.

## Workflow

1.  **Identify or Create Request File**: API requests are stored in `.md` files (e.g., `docs/api/get-users.md`).
2.  **Define Request Structure**:
    - Use YAML frontmatter for `method`, `url`, and `headers`.
    - Place the request body (JSON, text, etc.) below the frontmatter.
    - Support for environment variables using `{{VAR_NAME}}` syntax.
3.  **Execute Request**: Run the `execute_api_request.py` script to perform the call and see the response.

## File Format Example

```markdown
---
method: POST
url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
headers:
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
---

{
  "title": "foo",
  "body": "bar",
  "userId": 1
}
```

## Tools & Scripts

- **`scripts/execute_api_request.py`**: The primary execution engine.
  - **Usage**: `python scripts/execute_api_request.py <path_to_file>`
  - **Environment Variables**: The script automatically substitutes `{{ENV_VAR}}` with values from the current shell environment.

## Best Practices

- **Repository Structure**: Store API requests in a dedicated folder like `docs/api/` or `tests/integration/api/`.
- **Security**: Never hardcode secrets in the Markdown files. Use `{{API_TOKEN}}` and ensure the token is set in the environment or a `.env` file (which should be in `.gitignore`).
- **Responses**: When verifying an API, consider appending the response to a sibling `.response.md` file for record-keeping during development.
